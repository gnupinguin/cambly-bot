# Cambly Telegram Bot

### Goal
[Cambly](https://www.cambly.com/) - the service for conversational English practicing. 
After each lesson, the service sends a lesson summary in your email. 
It is uncomfortable, because very often email mailboxes contain a lot of emails, and you can lose your mail. 
This project aims to simplify lesson summary accessing and training via the [Telegram bot](https://t.me/CamblyBot).


### Current State
The project supports only Gmail mailbox.
